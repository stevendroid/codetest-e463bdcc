## Fibonacci viewer

*Please read these instructions carefully.* This test assumes familiarity with GIT, and with Android application architecture. The point of this test is to assess coding style and acumen in applciation architecture--not to make you solve silly problems. As such, the core problem in this test has been crafted to provide a balance of difficulty and simplicity. Here's a couple of administrative to go over first:

1. If you don't already have a GitHub account, sign up for free. 
2. Before you start the test, send an [email](mailto:jduv@aimconsulting.com) with your GitHub username. Wait for a response granting you push access to this repository.
3. In your favorite GIT UI or using terminal commands (my favorite), clone this repository to your local machine.

## Problem description

Write an application to alculate the and display each Fibonacci number from 1 to the max N possible with unsigned integers, and display each number in a table view.  The scrolling MUST remain smooth and the device must be usable. Some hints:

- Focus on building something that works one block at a time, then optimize where required.
- Focus on ensuring the UI of the application is usable and as simple as possible--yet usable. Unless you have extra time snazzy UI components will only slow you down.
- For this test, don't stress over battery.
- Don't worry about screen dimensions or OS versions. You may make assumptions and tell us what device and OS version we should test the app on.
- Focus also on architecting the application well. Ensure that it's modular, robust, and fault tolerant.
- Use Git as if this were a real project you were completing on a fully functioning Agile team. Make sure that if you create multiple feature/devleopment branches then you rebase when merging into master so your commit history is maintained.
- Try to use good, readable style.
- Try not to stress over the time limit. It's okay if you go over, but this will be assessed based on ROI. For example, if you take an extra hour and produce a fully working, beautifully architected application with a comprehensive suite of unit tests then you probably won't loose any points for going over.

## Rules of the game

- We expect unit tests where appropriate in the appropriate framework of your choice. Don't focus on coverage, instead focus on testing the crucial pieces.
- Don't worry about UI tests.
- Pick a GIT based workflow and use it. Checking directly in to master will result in a loss of points. If you are unfamiliar with GIT workflows, a quick and easy one is the [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow) flow.

Hope you have fun, and please send an [email](mailto:jduv@aimconsulting.com) if you have any questions.
